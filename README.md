This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to for loops and negative input.  A standard `for` loop with a negative starting condition results in an infinite loop at runtime, but TypeScript's type system does not catch this potential error during compilation. The `bug.ts` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.ts` shows a corrected version.  This example highlights a limitation of static analysis in catching all runtime issues.
